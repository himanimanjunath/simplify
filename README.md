# simplify 

Chrome extension built to create a cleaner, distraction-free web experience! Designed especially for neurodivergent users such as those with ADHD or autism. Our extension modifies webpages by changing fonts, disabling visual clutter, and offering a more accessible reading interface. Currently, itâ€™s optimized for cnn.com.

## Features
* Dyslexia-friendly font
* Hides distracting elements (images, advertisements, videos, footers)  
* Easy toggle via popup  
* Clean, readable layout  

## How We Built It
* For the frontend UI, we used **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript** to build the popup interface.
* The **Chrome Extensions API (Manifest v3)** was used to define the extension's structure/permissions, handle communication between the popup and browser tabs, register content scripts, and handle user interaction.
* We used **content scripting** to modify the actual content of the webpages (changing fonts, disabling distractions, etc). 

## How It Works
* A popup interface allows users to toggle features
* Background scripts communicate with browser tabs
* Content scripts manipulate DOM elements on supported websites

## What We Learned
This project was our first Chrome extension and first hackathon experience. We learned: 
* How Chrome Extensions work from scratch
* Effective teamwork and project collaboration
* Problem-solving under time pressure
* Reaching out to mentors/sponsors for help and applying their feedback
* How to laugh and cry over bugs together

When we hit walls while working (like unhiding cnn.comâ€™s header), the help we received from our hackathon sponsors and directors was technically valuable and inspiring.
